# [Project 1: Analyzing YouTube Trending Videos](https://github.com/kre8tions/Analyzing-YouTube-Trending-Videos)
Project Goal: The goal of this project is to analyze what YouTube videos are trending from a dataset scraped from YouTubeâ€™s Trending Page in order to find common characteristics of trending videos and attempt to predict and reproduce results.

### Our Approach:

* Start with Data Wrangling and EDA to get an understanding of our data
* Do some feature engineer if needed along the way
* Visualize our data
* Apply NLP on video descriptions to find most viewed topics and videos
* Cross validate our model
